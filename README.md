# msx [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/insin/msx.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/insin/msx)

[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)'s JSX Transformer, tweaked to output
calls to [Mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/)'s `m()` function in the
format it expects, with the tag name in a String and any children present
wrapped in an Array.

The current version of msx is based on version 0.10.0 of React's JSX Transformer.

Put the following jsx pragma at the beginning of files you want to process:

```javascript
/** @jsx m */
```

Only output has been tweaked, but there's no special treatment for custom tag
names - the transformer will output a warning if it sees an unknown tag name
and output an `m()` call anyway.

Other than that, the rest of React's JSX documentation should still apply:

### Command Line Usage

```
npm install -g msx
```

```
msx --watch src/ build/
```

Run `msx --help` for more information.

### Module Usage

```
npm install msx
```

```javascript
var msx = require('msx')
```

#### Module API

##### `msx.transform(source)`

Transforms XML-like syntax in the given source into native JavaScript function
calls using Mithril's `m()` function, returning the transformed source.

### Examples

Example inputs and outputs are in [test/jsx](https://github.com/insin/msx/tree/master/test/jsx)
and [test/js](https://github.com/insin/msx/tree/master/test/js), respectively.

An example [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/insin/msx/blob/master/gulpfile.js) is
provided, which implements an `msxTransform()` function using `msx.transform()`.
